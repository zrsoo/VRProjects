Bell hanging from a fixed thing
Inside the bell there is a clapper
If anything hits the bell, the bell should ring
If the clapper hits the bell, the bell should ring
3 joints on the bell
detect collisions between bell and clapper

force field in front of bell
doesn't let anything hit the bell
if you hit it enough times and hard enough, it breaks

in front of force field -> wall made of bricks

in front of wall -> cannon
shoots cannon balls, to break wall (force field)
hits bell, makes it ring

have other cannons that try to hit the shot ball and deflect it
